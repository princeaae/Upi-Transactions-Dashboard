ðŸ“Š UPI Transactions Dashboard â€“ Tableau Project

An interactive dashboard built using Tableau to analyze UPI transaction patterns across Indian cities, age groups, and payment methods. The project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, visualization, and insight extraction.

- Transaction volumes by city and merchant
- Usage patterns across age groups
- Preferred payment modes (Phone Number, QR Code, UPI ID)
- Device and purpose-based segmentation

Tools & Technologies Used

- Tableau Desktop Public Edition â€“ Visualization and dashboarding
- Microsoft Excel â€“ Data cleaning and formatting
- Python (Pandas) â€“ Data preprocessing (optional enhancement)
